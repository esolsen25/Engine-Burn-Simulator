# Engine-Burn-Simulator
Simulates a small isopropanol/nitrous oxide engine burn simulation with accurate mass-flow and thrust values

Edit the values for tank dimensions, throat/exit areas, etc., in order to optimize your
small rocket engine for a certain thrust/mass flow.

Inspired by HalfCatRocketry's HalfCatSim which implements this on an excel spreadsheet
